## Features
With CAMotics, you can simulate 3-axis [GCode](https://camotics.org/gcode.html) programs for [CNC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNC)s and visualize the results in 3D. CAMotics runs on Linux, OS-X or Windows. It's fast, easy to use and best of all [Open-Source](http://opensource.org/) and free.

With the power to simulate your CNC tool paths you will avoid dangerous and expensive mistakes. By looking at the built-in examples and using the [online documentation](https://camotics.org/manual.html) you'll be running your own simulations in no time. And, if you need more help, we'll be happy to answer your questions via the [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/camotics-users/boxsubscribe).

Would you start cutting without measuring first? Then why would you run a CNC program with out simulating? CAMotics will save you time and money and open up a world of creative possibilities by allowing you to rapidly visualize and improve upon designs without wasting materials or breaking tools. If you find CAMotics useful, consider [donating some money](https://camotics.org/#donations), otherwise it's totally free so go ahead.
