    <summary>Find duplicate files in a system.</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[__dupeGuru__ is a cross-platform (Linux, OS X, Windows) GUI tool to find duplicate files in a system. It’s written mostly in Python 3 and has the peculiarity of using multiple GUI toolkits, all using the same core Python code. On OS X, the UI layer is written in Objective-C and uses Cocoa. On Linux 7 Windows, it’s written in Python and uses Qt5.

__dupeGuru__ is a tool to find duplicate files on your computer. It can scan either filenames or contents. The filename scan features a fuzzy matching algorithm that can find duplicate filenames even when they are not exactly the same. dupeGuru runs on Mac OS X and Linux.

__dupeGuru__ is efficient. Find your duplicate files in minutes, thanks to its quick fuzzy matching algorithm. dupeGuru not only finds filenames that are the same, but it also finds similar filenames.

__dupeGuru__ is good with music. It has a special Music mode that can scan tags and shows music-specific information in the duplicate results window.

__dupeGuru__ is good with pictures. It has a special Picture mode that can scan pictures fuzzily, allowing you to find pictures that are similar, but not exactly the same.

__dupeGuru__ is customizable. You can tweak its matching engine to find exactly the kind of duplicates you want to find. The [Preference page](https://www.hardcoded.net/dupeguru/help/en/preferences.html) of the help file lists all the scanning engine settings you can change.

__dupeGuru__ is safe. Its engine has been especially designed with safety in mind. Its reference directory system as well as its grouping system prevent you from deleting files you didn’t mean to delete.

Do whatever you want with your duplicates. Not only can you delete duplicates files dupeGuru finds, but you can also move or copy them elsewhere. There are also multiple ways to filter and sort your results to easily weed out false duplicates (for low threshold scans).

Supported languages: English, French, German, Chinese (Simplified), Czech, Italian, Armenian, Russian, Ukrainian, Brazilian, Vietnamese.
