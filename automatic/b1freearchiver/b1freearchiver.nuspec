### Best speed to compression ratio
Though classic LZMA compression has been improving for over a decade, there are still some options to explore. For b1 we designed an improved compression algorithm with much better speed to compression ratio.

### Encryption with password
With encryption you can protect data with 256 bit AES encryption algorithm. No one will be able to read or extract original files without a password.
